* Implementation 1:
Consumed the Google Map's API to build a map application that shows the exact position of my partner in realtime. 
Showing my partners image as an indicator, the indicator also moves when my partner moves.

* Implementation 2:
Recreated the [pokemon project](https://github.com/Austinepass/collections/tree/main/Pokemon%20and%20image%20upload) using livedata and/or rxjava.

Toggle between the two implementaions with a BottomNavigationBar.

Firebase Realtime database was used to store and retrieve my partner's location coordinates.
