# Collections
In a bid to further hone my android development skills, I enrolled in a software training institute.
This repo contains a collection of apps I built during my stay at the institute.

I have learnt and can utilize the following languages and technologies:

* Kotlin
* Java
* XML
* Unit, UI(Espresso), and integration testing.
* ROOM/SQLite
* Navigation Components(Nav graph, NavController, etc)
* RXJava/RxKotlin
* Retrofit
* Coroutines, Viewmodels, LiveData
* ViewBinding/DataBinding
* Dependency Injection with Dagger Hilt
* Firebase
* Third party libraries and APIs
* Jira
* Continuous integration and continuous Development (Github actions)
* Version Control with Git and Github.
* Agile Methodology of project management.
* Javascript, React Native(still learning)

I apply the following programming concepts to the code I write
- Design Principles (OOP, SOLID)
- Design Patterns (MVC, MVVM, Observer Pattern)
