* Implementation 1 : An app that shows a list of all the pokemon characters and their pictures using the api from on https://pokeapi.co/.
When a pokemon character is clicked it lead to a page with full details of the character pulled from the appropriate endpoint with all images, 
move, abilities, stats etc showing at different sections.

* Implementation 2:
App allows user to select an image from the gallery and upload said image to the server(an endpoint was provided) and return a 
success or fail message.
Flow:
路 Ask for permission when app is launched
路 If permission is denied an error message is displayed
路 A button to ask again if permission is denied
路 If permission is granted, the user can then select an image from the gallery
